        "answer": "l design and advanced features such as IoT connectivity, sensor-based operation. Modular design for ease of use and optimal performance is the key. At Dostbin, we are committed to providing not only cutting-edge composting technology but also comprehensive support and services to our customers. From installation and setup to ongoing composting cycles, our team of experts ensures that every Dostbin user receives the assistance they need to maximise their composting experience. You are invited to share your knowledge and experience through our blogs page. We keep our composting community updated with relevant topics through our social media pages. OUR VISION Making every household free from wet waste collection issues and help them contribute to greener, cleaner environment by converting their kitchen waste to compost and nourish soil for chemical free food for us. OUR MISSION - To offer efficient, user-friendly composting solutions in manual and automatic variants, ensuring hassle-free home composting. - To be available to our customers with timely service and support in converting their wet waste to wealth for us. WHERE IT ALL STARTED CARBON FOOTPRINT Organic waste, such as food scraps and yard trimmings, is sent to landfills, It undergoes the anaerobic process of decomposition, which produces methane. It is a potent greenhouse gas. The leachate produced seeps in and contaminate underground water. Hence by composting, we can considerably reduce air, water and land pollution. Methane has a much higher global warming potential than carbon dioxide. So, diverting organic waste from landfills helps mitigate climate change and make Earth greener and cleaner for coming generations. Its an urgent requirement from urban households to reduce our carbon footprint and contribute to reduce the big gap in attainment of SDG 11 with sustainable cities and communities. The red flag for India can be seen here. RESPONSIBLE CITIZEN Practice of three Rs of waste management. First, the “Reduction” of consumption by buying only what we need. Second, “Reuse” of items whenever it is possible. Third, “Recycling” materials that Dostbin processes into new products. This helps conserve resources, minimize waste, reduce the energy and emissions associated with production and disposal. We can contribute by handing over segregated dry waste to responsible hands for recycling. However, wet waste can be recycled to compost at source by adopting Dostbin and handing over compost to us to supply to farmers. This also reduces air pollution by vehicles which transport our wet waste to landfills daily. Government also urges citizens for the same and soon it may become a mandate. BECOMING AN ETHICAL BRAND We're Proud of WHAT WE'RE DOING Our motive is to make every household comfortable handling their wet waste by effortless composting through our innovative product, support and services. We look forward to greener, cleaner environment for future generations and healthier, chemical free food for us. We wish to engage in supplying excess compost from all households to farmers and enrich our soil with nutrients which is lost in landfills. The vision of Dostbin is to establish a society where wet waste is viewed as a valuable resource rather than a burden. Each one of us can contribute to complete mother nature’s cycle of sending back the nutrients to mother earth for further production of healthy food for us.",

        "answer": "net. This blog will give insight into the comparative scrutiny of traditional versus composting waste disposal, stressing the significance of the economic, environmental, and social effects of every method. 1) Environmental Impact An Environment-friendly Solution: It is a safer technique of waste management that includes the decomposition of organic stuff into bio-stable compost. This procedure not only transforms waste but also decreases the impact of hazardous methane gas, a potent greenhouse gas released during the decomposition (anaerobic) of waste. This procedure also enriches the soil, enhances its structure, & promotes better growth of plants by returning precious nutrients to the earth. Environmental Alarms: Traditional techniques like incineration & landfilling, have a negative impact. Landfills are hazardous as they contribute to methane releases, water pollution, and the loss of nutrient-rich land. Incineration, while dropping the volume of waste, emits deadly pollutants into the atmosphere, resulting in health issues through air quality degradation. Both techniques also reduce the prospects of recycling organic waste into nutrient-packed compost, further depleting the soil value. 2) Social Impact Encouraging Environmental Education & Community Involvement: This unique process of composting also promotes environmental education & community involvement. Community programs bring folks together with a mutual aim of fostering sustainability. Besides, composting gives a hands-on learning experience, educating about the value of soil health, waste reduction, and a safe planet. Oldest Techniques of Waste Disposal: Old waste disposal approaches disconnect people from the waste they create. Once waste is gathered and sent to incinerators or landfills, it becomes “out of view, out of thought,” resulting in a lack of alertness about the social and environmental effects. This disconnect can deter efforts to endorse waste reduction in the community. 3) Economic Considerations Composting: Lucrative Waste Management: Composting can be a lucrative waste management solution, chiefly for companies and families that generate a noteworthy amount of organic waste. By composting one can easily reduce the necessity for expensive fertilizers & soil amendments, resulting in long-term savings. Moreover, composting can lower waste disposal expenses by reducing the quantity of waste sent to landfills. Old Waste Disposal: Financial Implications: Traditional waste disposal procedures come with ongoing expenses, including transportation expenses, landfill tipping charges, and environmental remediation expenses. As landfills reach volume, the charge of waste disposal is expected to increase, placing a financial burden on taxpayers and municipalities. Additionally, the failure to recover precious resources from organic waste denotes a missed economic prospect. Conclusion: When comparing composting to old waste disposal techniques, it becomes clear that composting delivers multiple social, economic, and environmental benefits. It not only controls the environmental effect of waste but also offers a great resource in the form of nutrient-packed compost. Composting also promotes environmental teaching, community involvement, and sustainable living practices. For those seeking to make a positive effect, composting is a great option. With Dostbin’s advanced composting solutions, you can effortlessly incorporate composting into your everyday routine, encouraging a greener planet and a healthier future.",

The process involves manually turning the handle to shred the waste. After 7-10 days, the content is shifted from the first stage to the second stage using a slider. In the second stage, the handle must be turned daily for about two minutes to aerate the pile. Finished compost is harvested by pulling the slider to the collection drawer. The video also explains that excess liquid (leachate) is collected and can be diluted 1:15 for use as a liquid fertilizer or drained. Finally, it mentions comparing the three DOSTBIN variants and pre-booking the Popular model.",

The setup involves preparing the remix powder, cocopeat, and charcoal accessories. After setup, the user adds kitchen waste and a handful of cocopeat to the hopper and presses the 'Shred' button, which automatically cuts the waste into smaller pieces. After about 7-10 days, the contents of the first chamber are transferred to the second chamber using a slider. In the second chamber, the user presses the 'Digest' button every 24 hours, which activates a rotor mixer and blower blade to aerate the compost for fast and effective digestion. Finished compost is ready after another 7-10 days in the second chamber and is harvested by pulling the slider to the collection drawer. The video notes that 10 kg of waste yields about 3 kg of compost, with the remaining liquid being nutrient-rich leachate that can be collected or drained.",

The process involves manually rotating the handle to shred the waste. After 7-10 days, or when the first stage is full, the content is shifted to the second stage by pulling and pushing a slider. In the second stage, the handle must be rotated for about two minutes every day for aeration. After another week or 10 days, the finished compost is harvested from the collection drawer. The video also explains that excess liquid (leachate) is collected and can be diluted 1:15 for use as a liquid fertilizer or drained.",
